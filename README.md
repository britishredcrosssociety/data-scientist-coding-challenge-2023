# British Red Cross Data Scientist Coding Challenge 2023

Scraping, cleaning, analysing, and visualising open data is a common task you would experience as a Data Scientist at the British Red Cross. Our operational teams often require location-based insights around different types of inequalities.

Using your programming language of choice, explore the [Households by deprivation dimensions](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/datasets/c2021ts011) and [Household language](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/datasets/c2021ts025) datasets from the recently published 2021 Census. We would like you to tell us a story based on your analysis of these datasets. Please prepare a short presentation (10 minutes maximum) to deliver at your interview, telling us about your findings and your approach.

Your answer should include programmatically scraping the data from the web, performing exploratory and/or inferential analyses, and visualising the results.

We would also like you to submit the code you write for this challenge. To do so, please:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Write and commit your code.
3. Submit a pull request before your interview starts.

Note: when selecting the parameters for the data, be sure to select `Lower layer Super Output Areas` for the type of geography.
